                <blockqoute>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <sup>1</sup>When i was young, my mom always taught me how to communicate,
                    even when i'm mad, sad, happy, etc. <sup>2</sup>Because communication can helped us to talk our thoughts and
                    emotions by saying it calmly and saying it from the bottom of your heart. <sup>3</sup>Communication skills
                    emotions by saying it calmly and saying it from the bottom of your heart.<sup>4</sup> Communication skills
                    helped to make friends here in Manila. <sup>5</sup>Because if you have a "pakikisama" here, you can have friends
                    easily and make a friendship that you've ever had. <sup>6</sup>This can also help you to communicate even if
                    your under pressure, because this will taught you to be calm in every scenario and to think even if
                    you are under pressure.<sup>7</sup> I'll share one of my memories about communication skills. <sup>8</sup>When i was in
                    senior high school, i'm a bit shy because that's the year of pandemic here in Philippines.<sup>9</sup> When we
                    came back to face to face, i can't talk to my schoolmates because i'm shy to have a interaction with
                    them. But the week after that happened, i realized that having an communication helps me to be
                    confident and expressing my emotions to them. <sup>10</sup>That week also is our class voting, and when i let my
                    thoughts win, i easily win PRO in our schools.<sup>11</sup> That's why it helped me because it can benefit my
                    life going in college. <sup>12</sup>When we are growing up, all of us felt shocked and anxiety because we don't
                    know how our life's gonna be in the future.<sup>13</sup> But luckily, if you have Emotional Intelligence, you
                    will be fine and you can talked to other people and make friends. <sup>14</sup>Communication skills and Emotional
                    Intelligence are one of my skills, thankfully i learned them because it helps me here in Manila, and
                    i'm thanking also my parents for helping me to develop that.<sup>15</sup> I developed Emotional Intelligence to
                    myself because i based it on my own experiences in life, and my expression to the world.<sup>16</sup> If you have
                    this three, your life can have an amazing story and compassion. <sup>17</sup>Because when u can express on
                    someone, and listen to their opinion, our life will be good and can have a moral lesson on each and
                    every decision that we make. <sup>18</sup>But always remember that a great skills comes at our house first.<sup>19</sup>
                    Because when we have a skills like this, all thanks to our parents who taught us how to have a good
                    skills and passion.<sup>20</sup> This lesson taught me to express my love and support to my parents for having me
                    a great skills in life, people, and even to myself. </blockqoute>

                    <blockqoute>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <sup>1</sup>Hobbies are one of the most enjoying thing to do because
                        this helps us in our everyday life, having fun while you learn something is one of the traits on
                        having hobbies.<sup>2</sup> One of the most hobbies that i love is playing basketball.<sup>3</sup> This sports helped me
                        to develop my skills and talents, because while playing this sports, my mind and heart are full
                        of happiness and love.<sup>4</sup> This sports helped me on my everyday life because it improve my physical
                        and mental health, and this helped me to clear my mind while playing it and benefits my body.<sup>5</sup>
                        Basketball also helped me to provide to my parents, because i gave some of my earnings,
                        jerseys,and trophies to my parents.<sup>6</sup> And i'm so happy because they always have a smile on their
                        faces and assuring me that they are proud of me.<sup>7</sup> One of my hobbies also is playing playing video
                        games.<sup>8</sup> Playing games became my hobby because when it's my free time, i always play some games in
                        my pc and my phone.<sup>9</sup> When i'm resting after training, this always comes in my mind and playing it
                        became my happiness because when i'm playing with my friends, we always laugh and we always
                        enjoy to play the games.<sup>10</sup> Also, one of my hobbies is to ride a bike.<sup>11</sup> This always helps me to
                        rewind in life and can also help me to improve my physicality and to be healthy.<sup>12</sup> Riding a bike
                        while on the top of the mountain are so peaceful and quiet, always watching the sunset while
                        resting on the top became my passion.<sup>13</sup> I remembered when we are riding with my friends, i'm not
                        in condition that time, when we go uphill the mountain, i got dizzy and i throw out.<sup>14</sup> So my
                        friends take care of me until we reach the top of the mountain, and luckily i got well on the
                        top of the mountain, and my friend said that "Pre, muntik kana kunin ni Lord, sakto pataas pa
                        naman tayo", we laughed about it and it was a great time.<sup>15</sup> I dont know if this is a hobby, but
                        one of my hobbies is to clean the house.<sup>16</sup> It's like my stress reliever when i cleaned the house
                        and make me proud of myself.<sup>17</sup> It's just weird because cleaning our house helps me when i'm stress
                        and having anxiety.<sup>18</sup> It's so peaceful when you're the only one on the house and decide to clean
                        up.<sup>19</sup> I don't know if that's a hobby but i'll take it haha. <sup>20</sup>And i'm not satisfied to go out or
                        play basketball and games when the house is not clean, so maybe it's a special hobby of mine to
                        put it here.</blockqoute>

            <h3>
                <blockqoute> <b> Interest </b></blockqoute>

                        <blockqoute>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <sup>1</sup>Interest is based on your hardwork and dedication,
                            when you don't put a work on it, your true potential on your interest can disappear. <sup>2</sup>One of
                            my intereset are playing some instruments, and i mean instruments. <sup>3</sup>I'm not bragging it because
                            i workhard on it. <sup>4</sup>But one of my favorite instrument that i played is drums. <sup></sup>I remembered
                            when my brother is teaching me how to play drums.<sup>5</sup> On that day, i'm not invested to play any
                            instruments because i don't know how to do it and to proper fundamentals.<sup>6</sup> But i keep it and
                            improve it step by step. <sup>7</sup>Then, on the battle that i mentioned on the last activity, when we
                            fought on battle of the bands.<sup>8</sup> I realized that my brother is right, i can truly maximize my
                            potential on playing drums.<sup>9</sup> This also became my hobby but for a while because we have a
                            battle of the band.<sup>10</sup> But until now, when my bandmates are having gatherings, i'm always G to
                            play again and just have fun.<sup>11</sup> I also play guitar, bass guitar, and piano. <sup>12</sup>When pandemic
                            days, i got nothing to do but play some instrument. <sup>13</sup>This became my pass time because we all
                            know how bored pandemic days are.<sup>14</sup> So i play and play each and everyday even if i'm alone.<sup>15</sup>
                            This put a spark in my instrument passion because when i was a kid, i dreamed to play some
                            instrument to impress my family and friends. <sup>16</sup>When intereset becomes a habit, that's where talent comes out.<sup>17</sup>
                            And ofcourse, i'm interested at coding. <sup>18</sup>I chose this course not just because it has money, but i enjoy every challenges
                            that IT industry gave to me.<sup>19</sup> One of the reason also is because when i was a kid, i always watched my brother to code 
                            when he was in college, so that became my inspiration to code because i wanna be like him soon. <sup>20</sup>But overall, interest is one 
                            of the reason why we all have talents, because we are curious in life and how's it gonna be.<sup>21</sup> On that simple curiousity,
                            some of us develop skills, hobbies, and interest. And some of us became good in life and on our daliy battles.
